We have got this [very interesting question from the Liferay forums](https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/53456231).
Sadly, it was not going to be trivial to implement that, and I had no time to a very detailed blog posts.
To try to help, I've written a somewhat ugly prototype of the requested customization. Each important step is
documented in a commit with a supposedly comprehensive message. So, to get some ideas on how to implement
the resource view, go to [the commits](https://github.com/brandizzi/aui-scheduler-view-resources/commits/master) (starting
on [the very first one](https://github.com/brandizzi/aui-scheduler-view-resources/commit/3b016c4e682431feb19e47145eaab2aa6aa176b0))
read each message and study each diff. I believe it can be at least slightly illustrating about Alloy UI's scheduler
structure.
